  abstract : 1. data abstract is used to hide certain details and showing essential details to the user.
             2. abstract keyword is a non-access modifier used for classes and methods.
             3. abstract classes cannot be instantiated, it's should be extended to (Instantiate, define abstract methods, override
                abstract class methods)
             4. abstract class may have zero or more abstract methods but if a class contain abstract method its class should be 
                define as abstract class.
             
             Abstract class: is a restricted class that cannot be used to create objects 
                             (to access it, it must be inherited from another class).

             Abstract method: can only be used in an abstract class, and it does not have a body. 
                              The body is provided by the subclass (inherited from).
